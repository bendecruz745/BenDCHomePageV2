            Hello, I'm Ben (probably already picked that up), a fledgling Full
            Stack Developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've had an interest in computers since I was introduced to them at
            a young age, as I was always amazed at what they are able to do and
            what people can do with them.
          </p>
          <p>
            I did not go to University due to lacking requirements, however a
            few months after finishing High School in February 2015, I somehow
            had the luck and privilege of being hired on as an Intern at the
            Reserve Bank of Australia for their 2 year IT Intern program. This
            was a life changing event for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mostly because of the life-long friends I made from some of the
            other Interns, but also of the experience and knowledge I was able
            to accumulate when rotating through their Service Desk, Network
            Services, System Services (server management), IT Operations and
            Security teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few months after finishing up my Internship on Feb 2017, on May
            2017 I was hired on as a temp IT Support Officer at Parker Hannifin
            Australia, moving onto a salary role on Sep 2017.
          </p>
          <p>
            My role at Parker Hannifin's Australian branch ended up being a type
            of jack-of-all-trades role, covering level 1-3 support. I was first
            in line for phone calls and the main person managing the ticket
            queue. Issues I looked at could range from hardware & software,
            server, telecommunication, networking, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my time at Parker, due to (in my opinion) a small IT Support
            team (Network Administrator, IT Manager & Myself), looking after
            branches all over Australia & a few in New Zealand led to some
            straining and high pressure situations.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, this time has sharpened my problem solving ability and
            reaction time, and shaped my current work ethic as being persistent.
            It exposed me to many problems from many angles and to be honest, it
            sharpened my Googling skills big time for finding solutions to those
            very odd issues that pop up here and there.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started undertaking Australian Institute of ICT's Certified Full
            Stack Developer course around August 2022 and decided to leave
            Parker on September 2022 to dedicate myself to the course and also
            partly a mental break.
          </p>
          <p>
            I finished the course on Apr 2023 and have since started working on
            some personal projects here and there to build up my knowledge &
            practical ability further, whilst applying to some jobs here and
            there when they pop up. (You are likely here as you may have seen
            the link on my LinkedIn or on my resume)
          </p>
          <p>
            That is pretty much where I am at the moment. If you would like my
            Resume, send me an email via the mail link below, or if you already
            have it and are looking for a Full Stack Developer, hopefully I am
            what you are looking for!
